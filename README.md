# Prefix to Assembly Code Generator

This project is a Prefix to Assembly Code Generator, implemented in C++. It takes a prefix expression as input, processes it, generates assembly code based on the expression, and calculates the result of the expression. The generated assembly code is saved to a file named `assemblyCode.txt`.

## Features

- Converts a prefix expression to assembly code.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, ^).
- Processes operands and operators using a stack-based approach.
- Validates the input prefix expression.
- Provides a simple interactive environment to input variable values.
